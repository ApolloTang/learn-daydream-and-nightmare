<!-- # Learn Daydream & Nightmare -->

Just when you thought the internet couldn't get any _more_ awesome,
you discover that you've got "***web super powers***"!!

## _Why_?

Testing a web page/site/app to _confirm_ that it is working as _expected_
_used_ to be difficult and _slow_.
So most web developers/designers did not bother with _automated_ testing.
Instead _most_ people do (_mannual_) "click though" or "visual regression" testing.
The problem is that


## _What_?

This guide is _an introduction to_ "***web super powers***"
_for **complet beginners**_.<br />
_Unusually_ for a [dwyl "learn" tutorial](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Adwyl+learn)
will be focussing on learning **_two_ tools**
in the next **20-30 minutes**. <br />
(_we usually try and learn/teach **one** thing at a time,
  but in this case the tools go together like electricity and a **lightbulb**_!)

### Daydream


### Nightmare

+ Website: http://nightmarejs.org (_which **really** does not do it justice!_)
+ GitHub: https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare

### Not Covered

Google recently decided to call their VR product "Daydream" ... https://vr.google.com/daydream
this tutorial is not for that ...
but if anyone _asks_ us we will gladly write a "how to build VR apps" tutorial!!

## _Who_?

It is a "_clich√©_" to say that your product/service is "_for **everyone**_"
and instead we should "_focus_" on a _specific_ "***target user***" ... <br />
So, here goes: **Daydream** is _useful_ ***only*** to people that use web browsers
and want to ***learn how to automate tasks*** <br />
so they can ***get more done in less time***.
***Everyone*** `else` should stick with their _existing_ activities. <br />
_There_, a nice _specific_ "***target user***"
for this tutorial; _better_...? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Nightmare is _probably_ only useful to the people _making_ the web site/app
because it's more "_cody_" ... but as you will (_hopefully_) see by the end
of 30 mins of learning "***web super powers***"


### Are You _`New`_ To _Automated_ Testing?

While _this_ tutorial has ***No Pre-requisites***
(_other than a computer & Chrome web browser_),
we have written an _introductory_ step-by-step guide
to help _anyone_ learn (_automated_) "***Test Driven Development***" (**TDD**)
see: [github.com/dwyl/**learn-tdd**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)


## _How_?
